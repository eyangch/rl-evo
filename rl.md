## Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning chooses the action with the highest expected rewards. The learning part comes in when trying to estimate what these rewards are. In essence, this algorithm tries to predict the outcome if the agent takes a certain action. After the agent "explores" the world a bit, it can build up a "memory" of environments, actions, and rewards (outcomes). It can then train to better react to the situations it has seen by modifying the parameters (weights) of its neural network through techniques such as [gradient descent](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gradient_descent.html).
