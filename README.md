# Reinforcement Learning vs Evolution

Reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms both aim to train an agent, or robot, to accomplish some task. For example, these algorithms can be used to create robots that can play games, navigate environments, and interact with the real world. These algorithms also utilize neural networks as the structure of its "brain". Neural networks take in data (in this case usually its environment) and produce an output (in this case its next action).

However, reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms have completely different ways of learning and gathering new information using the neural networks. How do they work?
